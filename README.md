# aoeui for Light Table

Finding just the right text editing setup can be hard. If you happen to be a [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) user, it can be even harder. A lot of editors are optimized for QWERTY, making the keyboard shortcuts awkward to use in Dvorak.

I'm a long-time fan of [aoeui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard), a simple CLI text editor with keyboard shortcuts optimized for Dvorak. It's somewhat [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)y in that you can move around and do things in your editor using `Ctrl+<key>` shortcuts, but the author of aoeui's intent was to create a minimal text editor with only as many commands as you need. Emacs is awesome, but it provides such a bounty of features that (if you're like me) it's easy to end up not using most of them because you can't remember the shortcuts. The philosophy of aoeui is that your text editor shouldn't occupy that much real estate in your brain; if you can easily remember everything your text editor can do, then the rest of your brain can focus on actually editing stuff instead of tinkering with your editor setup or looking up keyboard shortcuts.

I also really like Light Table for a variety of reasons (the [official site](http://www.lighttable.com) gives a pretty good overview of its greatness), one of which is how easy it is to customize. So, an aoeui plugin for Light Table should give me just as much Emacs as I want without having to go full-on Emacs! :P
